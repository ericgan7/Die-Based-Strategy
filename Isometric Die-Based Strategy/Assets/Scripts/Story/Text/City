This tavern has seen better days, but its still among the better places in the city. You all crowd around a table lamenting your fortunes. 
*   [Complain about the docks]
    Fishermen come back with frightening stories of strange creatures out there. Hopefully nothing more than stories.
*   (guard)[Grumble about guard duty]
    High taxes and poor harvests make for a hard year. The desperate are driven more frequently to crime.
*   [Moan about your ill fortune]
    Trade has been slow and jobs are few.

-Roache's carvan was suppose to come in a few days ago. Third carvan to come go missing this month. If this keeps up, there will be bread riots.

*   [Complain about the god King]

    **  [What if he does not return?]
        Then fewer and fewer will join the Order of Light and others will take its place. Theres no reason to - 
    **  [They are the reason for all these wars]
        He also unified the Five Kingdoms. Look, I'm - 
    **  [Drop the subject]
        Yeah, there are too many ears around. Let's go to - 

*   [Something must be done]
    Hah. Perhaps we should join up with a merchant. Probably pay well given the state of things.

-  A scuffle breaks out over a few drinks.
Looks like its time to move on. Best escalate it anymore, especially when { guard: we're|I'm } not on duty. Let's...
Shit. Look's like one of the gangs is making a play for power. Guard up!

//After the fight
Where's the damn guard? They should be here by now. 

Let's get out while we can.
