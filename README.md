# Die Based Strategy

  I was inspired by the game play of The Banner Saga, by Stoic Gamesand published by Versus Evil. However, I wanted to give my own take on it with more interesting abilities and less punishing health system. I also wanted a more personal story for the characters in the game, which I felt was missing in The Banner Saga. When I played through Pyre, by Super Giant Games, I really like how unique and special the characters felt. I want to try and combine the character driven story and plot of Pyre with the gameplay The Banner Saga.
  Part of the combat is also inspired by Armello. I really liked the look and feel of the UI in that game and its combat rolls.
  
  This is still a work in progress.
  Currently working on the art and story of each character.
